# Cincinnatus
I have a passionate hatred for the new Windows 10 Photos app. It's slow to open, doesn't let you zoom in past like 1.5x, and just ultimately feels like it was made for tablet casuals. Thus, I made Cincinnatus, a lightweight photo viewer for Windows that acts more like its (superior) predecessor.

Cincinnatus is quick to open, allows ridiculous levels of zooming, allows you to specify antialiasing algorithms (including none, the default), and allows you to change the background color.
